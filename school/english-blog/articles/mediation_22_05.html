        <article class="blog-post">
            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
            <p>Have you ever asked yourself if the American Dream could also exist in Germany? My American friend runs a blog about that, and I found a perfect story: the life of German entrepreneur Dirk Roßmann. He visited his old school and shared some personal advice with the students. I want to tell you what he said and maybe it helps you too!</p>

            <p>Dirk Roßmann is the founder of one of the biggest drugstore chains in Germany. But his start in life was not easy. When he was young, his teacher told him he was not smart enough for middle school. He had bad grades and didn't enjoy school. Today, he runs a company with 56,000 employees and earns almost 10 billion euros every year!</p>

            <p>When he spoke to students at his former school, he said that grades are not everything. Success can come later in life. His biggest advice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Never give up, even if things are hard.</li>
                <li>Learn English well – it helps when working internationally.</li>
                <li>Learn basic maths, but even more important: stay motivated and keep trying.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>His wife always tells him: "If they throw you out the front door, come back in through the back."</p>

            <p>He also said that we don't only learn for school, we learn for life. You have to stay curious and interested in the world around you. His dream was to be free and independent. He wanted money, not for being rich, but for having freedom and making his own decisions.</p>

            <p>In short, Dirk Roßmann's story shows that failure in school does not mean failure in life. With hard work and strong will, anything is possible.</p>

            <p>What do you think? Can Germany be a land of opportunities too? Let me know in the comments!</p>

                    <p>This is such an inspiring story! It really shows that success isn't just about grades. I especially liked the part about learning English - it's so true in today's global world.</p>

                    <p>I actually met Dirk Roßmann once at a business event. His energy and positive attitude are incredible. The story about his wife's advice is something I'll never forget!</p>

                    <p>As a teacher, I think this story is very important for students to hear. Not everyone learns the same way, and success can come in many different forms.</p>
